On the other hand, our experience reproducing more than 200 papers shows that it can take weeks and months of painful and repetitive interactions between teams to reproduce artifacts. This effort includes decrypting numerous README files, examining ad-hoc artifacts and containers, and figuring out how to reproduce computational results. Furthermore, snapshot containers pose a challenge to optimize algorithms’ performance, accuracy, power consumption and operational costs across diverse and rapidly evolving software, hardware, and data used in the real world.\nIn this talk, I will explain how our practical artifact evaluation experience and the feedback from researchers and evaluators motivated us to develop a simple, intuitive, technology agnostic, and English-like scripting language called Collective Mind (CM). It helps to automatically adapt any given experiment to any software, hardware, and data while automatically generating unified README files and synthesizing modular containers with a unified API. It is being developed by MLCommons to facilitate reproducible AI/ML Systems research and minimizing manual and repetitive benchmarking and optimization efforts, reduce time and costs for reproducible research, and simplify technology transfer to production. I will also present several recent use cases of how CM helps MLCommons, the Student Cluster Competition, and artifact evaluation at ACM/IEEE conferences. I will conclude with our development plans, new challenges, possible solutions, and upcoming reproducibility and optimization challenges powered by the MLCommons Collective Knowledge platform and CM: access.cKnowledge.org.\nBio: Grigori Fursin is a co-chair of the MLCommons task force on automation and reproducibility, president of the cTuning foundation, and founder of cKnowledge.org. After completing a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Edinburgh, Grigori was a senior tenured research scientist at INRIA, co-director of the Intel Exascale Lab, founder of the cKnowledge.io platform, and Vice President of MLOps at OctoML.

However, if the execution performance or efficiency is the science result, matters are more complex. It may not be sufficient to package codes in containers. In fact, containers may disturb the performance results and reproducibility. We outline a set of techniques to facilitate performance reproducibility in various settings. Some performance results may be linked to specific computer architectures or even specific system configurations that may not be accessible to other researchers or even the original team after a software update. We outline techniques to help researchers interpret results on the original system even if it is practically impossible to reproduce the original results. We discuss such techniques both in the context of pure performance but also in the context of the emerging field of data science and artificial intelligence that often allows for a performance-accuracy tradeoff. All-in-all, our work provides a set of guidelines to follow to support reproducible science of performance and benchmarking.\nBio: Torsten Hoefler is a Professor of Computer Science at ETH Zurich, a member of Academia Europaea, and a Fellow of the ACM and IEEE.

Fostering the free exchange of ideas requires building a conference that welcomes people of all backgrounds. Diversity of opinion and background is a fundamental strength of our community. The members of our community must have the freedom to espouse and explore a wide range of ideas. Toward that goal, ACM REP ‘23 aims to create spaces where every participant can express themselves without fear of judgment or harassment.\nThe ACM REP Code of Conduct guides the expected, professional behavior of conference participants, including:\nTreating everyone with respect and consideration; under the umbrella of respect, we expect all participants to be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person and online. Communicating openly and thoughtfully with others and being considerate of the multitude of views and opinions that may be different than your own. Being respectful and mindful in your critique of ideas. Being mindful of your fellow participants, including (but not limited to): Respecting participants wishes to not be photographed; Respecting participant gender pronouns; and Respecting the space of others and their right to engage or not engage in conversation. We believe differences of opinion are a natural part of social and academic life and are important to work through when building community and learning from one another. At the same time, we acknowledge that societal power structures are even more challenging in academia, which is an inherently hierarchical community. In order to foster an environment of inclusion, we do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or abuse in any form. Participants who engage in harassment may be removed from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.\nUnacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in ACM-REP activities, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of conference activities; offensive, degrading, humiliating, harmful, or prejudicial verbal or written comments or visual images related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, age, appearance, or other personal characteristics; unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal/physical conduct of a sexual nature; inappropriate or gratuitous use of nudity, sexual images, or stereotyped images including using an activity-related communication channel to display or distribute sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or discriminatory images or messages; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; unwelcome and uninvited attention or contact; physical assault (including unwelcome touch or groping); real or implied threat of physical harm; real or implied threat of professional or financial damage or harm. Harassment can occur when there is no deliberate intention to offend. Be careful in the words that you choose. Harassment committed in a joking manner or disguised as a compliment still constitutes unacceptable behavior. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior If an ACM-REP participant engages in prohibited behavior, the conference committee reserves the right to take any action the committee deems appropriate, including removing the participant from the conference.\nHow to Report Unacceptable Behavior In the event of unacceptable behavior, participants may wish to inform a person in authority. During ACM REP, participants should reach out to one of the General or Program Chairs (see list below). These individuals can provide information about the process for handling complaints or handling immediate onsite needs.\nThere may be cases (such as those involving Title IX issues in the United States and venue- or employer-specific policies) where an on-site person who is informed of harassment will be required to file a complaint.
