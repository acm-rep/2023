# Hotels

ACM REP ‘23 discounted room blocks are available at several local hotels for the conference attendees. Attendees need to make reservations directly and will be responsible for their own room, tax and incidental charges. 

Please make reservations early. The special rate cut-off dates vary depending on the hotel. Summer is the high season for tourists in Santa Cruz, and your chances of booking a hotel room anywhere after June 20th are very slim, and if you do, it will be much more expensive than the ACM REP ‘23 rates.

Individual hotels have different requirements for registration such as registration codes and cut-off dates, so please read the instructions for each hotel.

We are in the process of adding more hotel choices.
