        Does your organization want to support and promote reproducibility and open science in academia? Do you want to foster collaboration between industry, academia and open source communities? Why not be a sponsor for the 2023 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability (ACM REP '23)?  

        Organizations that sponsor this event will be given public acknowledgement on the Symposium website and agenda, and get free passes for in-person participation.
