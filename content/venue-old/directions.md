We recommend to use the most direct flight to San Jose (SJC, closest), San Francisco (SFO), or Oakland (OAK) International Airports and then rent a car to get to Santa Cruz. Google Maps does a reasonable job finding the fastest route to Santa Cruz. However, the best routes and driving times can vary significantly depending on day of week and time of day. So when you plan your trip in advance, we recommend Google Maps or similar service with a “Depart at” and “Arrive by” functionality. Also, during your trip watch for new route recommendations due to accidents to avoid significant traffic delays.

NOTE ON SUMMER TRAFFIC: On the weekends, Santa Cruz is a major destination for travelers from the San Francisco Bay Area, and traffic on Highway 17 through the Santa Cruz Mountains from San Jose to Santa Cruz can be extremely congested. If you are driving and arrive on a weekend, please be aware that until about 1:00 or 2:00pm each day, it could take over 2 hours to reach Santa Cruz from San Jose.

# Getting Around

Traffic is also heavy in Santa Cruz itself. Your hotel concierge should be able to suggests good ways to get around town without having to drive and park.

## Carpooling

We strongly urge those of you who are driving to consider carpooling with other attendees. Traffic, even in summer, can be heavy on campus and it might be easier and simpler to carpool wherever possible.

With that in mind we have set up a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sq768MlMwVqDscfSLPiimppUtnYWljdtNDwQpCmNHyo/edit?usp=sharing) where you can sign up to offer a ride or request a ride.

If you are looking for riders, enter your information for each day in the green “Looking for Riders” sections on the list. If you are looking for a driver, then enter your information for each day in the blue “Looking for Drivers” sections on the list.

## Uber & Lyft

lternatively, using Uber or Lyft is another way to get to campus without having to find parking.

## Santa Cruz Metro Transit

The local public transportation system is also a fine way to get around and has regularly scheduled buses with multiple stops on UC Santa Cruz campus, including "UCSC - Main Gate" which is a short walk to the Hay Barn where the conference takes place on Days 1 and 2, and "Science Hill (UCSC)" which is a short walk to Engineering 2 where the tutorials and workshops on Day 3 are located. It costs $2 cash (need to have exact amount) for one ride. You can also order and buy passes [online](https://scmtd.square.site/) ([Fares](https://www.scmtd.com/en/fares/fares), [Map](https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes/schedule/map), [Schedule](https://www.scmtd.com/en/routes/schedule)).

## UCSC Shuttles

In addition to the Santa Cruz Metro buses, UCSC runs [campus shuttle buses](https://taps.ucsc.edu/buses-shuttles/campus-shuttles.html). The shuttles (aka “UCSC Loop Bus”) are free and useful for getting around within campus ([Map and Schedule](https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/campus-transit-schedule-11x17.pdf)). For Days 1 and 2 the bus stop closest to the Hay Barn is "Lower Campus". On Day 3 the bus stop closest to the tutorials and workshops is “Science Hill”, the one closest to Physical Sciences and Jack Baskin Engineering buildings near the upper left of the map. Buses operate in both directions and both directions are about the same distance between the campus main entrance and the Science Hill (for buses going the clockwise direction, use the "Barn Theater" bus stop across the street from the "Main Entrance" bus stop).

## Conference Parking

Daily parking permits can to be purchased at the Main Entrance Kiosk (map coordinates M-7, see [campus parking map](https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/parking-map.pdf)) or the TAPS Sales Office (L-7). For Days 1 and 2, there is a small number of parking spaces available across the Hay Barn at parking lots 115 and 116 (L-8). Lot 116 also has a few parking spaces that can be paid for via the [ParkMobile app](https://parkmobile.io/) (also useful for parking in downtown Santa Cruz).  For Day 3, Google Maps driving directions are available for “UCSC Core West Structure” (Lot 112, map coordinates C-4).
