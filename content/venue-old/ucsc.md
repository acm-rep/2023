Since its founding in 1965, the University of California, Santa Cruz, has earned international distinction as a university with high-impact research and an uncommon commitment to teaching and public service.

A campus with world-class facilities and one of the most visually spectacular settings in higher education, UC Santa Cruz offers rigorous academic programs and cutting-edge research opportunities that teach students how to think, not what to think. Commitments to environmental stewardship and community engagement are central to UCSC’s core values.

From 652 students in 1965, the campus has grown to its current enrollment of around 19,000 students (2021-2022). Undergraduates pursue bachelor’s degrees in 65 different [majors](https://admissions.ucsc.edu/find-your-program) supervised by divisional deans of [arts](https://arts.ucsc.edu), [engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu), [humanities](https://humanities.ucsc.edu), [physical & biological sciences](https://pbsci.ucsc.edu), and [social sciences](https://socialsciences.ucsc.edu).

Graduate students work toward graduate certificates, master’s degrees, or doctoral degrees in 65 [academic programs](https://www.gradadmissions.ucsc.edu/graduate-studies) under the supervision of the divisional and graduate deans.

The 10 UC Santa Cruz undergraduate colleges — each a separate community with its own buildings and administration — are built around a core of shared university facilities. These include the main and science/engineering libraries, performing arts buildings, visual arts studios, classrooms, computer facilities, and a complex of highly specialized buildings for the physical and biological sciences, and for engineering. Athletic facilities are provided on the east and west sides of the campus.

UC Santa Cruz is increasing both its enrollment and resources and diversifying its educational and research opportunities. New academic programs are considered and added when desirable and feasible. The campus’s physical growth is guided by its most recent [Long-Range Development Plan](https://lrdp.ucsc.edu/). In 2013-14 the campus initiated a [strategic planning process](https://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/) to identify priorities and published its final report in March 2017.

A number of state-of-the-art buildings have been completed on campus in recent years, including the Biomedical Sciences Building, the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, the Digital Arts Research Center, and the McHenry Library expansion. A restored and updated [Quarry Amphitheater](https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/quarry-restoration.html) reopened in fall 2017.

UC Santa Cruz continues to move forward with its [Silicon Valley Campus](https://siliconvalley.ucsc.edu/), a multi-disciplinary teaching and research hub that is home to a master’s degree program in games and playable media, engineering faculty, the new office of industry alliances and technology commercialization, UCSC Silicon Valley Extension, and UC Scout.
