The ACM Conference for Reproducibility and Replicability (ACM REP) brings together a broad and inclusive intellectual community around the issues of reproducibility of computational research, including practical, actionable aspects of reproducibility in broad areas of computational science and data exploration, with special emphasis on issues in which community collaboration can be essential for adopting novel methodologies, techniques and frameworks aimed at addressing some of the challenges we face today. The ACM REP conference series is associated with the [ACM Emerging Interest Group for Reproducibility and Independent Verification](https://reproducibility.acm.org/) (see [here](https://acm-rep.github.io/history) for ACM REP's history).
